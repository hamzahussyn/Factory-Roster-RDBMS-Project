# Factory-Roster-RDBMS-Project

This project was created for the course of Relational Database Management System.
The crux of this project was learning how to populate tables with thousands of randomly generated records using Transact SQL.
Many type casting techniques were also employed to get randomly generated values for feilds such as time.
Complex sample queries are also included to verify the records in the tables.
The tool used was : Microsoft SQL Server.

A few tables were manually populated, which were:
shifts: 1 and 2, from 06:00:00 to 12:00:00 and from 12:00:00 to 18:00:00 respectively,
stations: 31-61, ten on each floor,
floor: 1, 2, 3.

The rest of the tables are populated using TSQL scripts.


Fair use for learning SQL and database design is allowed.
